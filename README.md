# Wow Classic Raid Analyser

Raid analyser site based on [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

The purpose is to make many calls to warcraft logs apis to retrieve information and display it in a table for a quick glance to identify problematic areas.

## TODO
* Check for consumable buffs on combat start to include pre-pull consumes in counts.
* Add per-fight filters (All, Trash, Boss #1, Boss #2, etc.)
* Fill in the enchants column with useful data.
* Add routes for class/role filters to for easy url sharing.
* Healing stats (Effective Heal, Overheal, Wasted Heal)
* Tank stats (Crit immune, Crush immune, Health pool, Mitigation)
